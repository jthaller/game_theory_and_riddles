# game_theory_and_riddles
Here are some PDF's and Mathematica notebooks for riddles I wanted to solve or some game theory I was interested in. These were mostly things I did over winter break of for the Willimas magazine, Hekademos. If there isn't a latex file for a given PDF, it is because I made it in Overleaf.

I have also added all the sorting algorithms I've written in python. I wrote them all and more in JAVA back in high school, but I rewrote them all in python as practice.

Recently, I've started doing more coding challenges on leet-code and hacker rank. I'm including those here, too.
